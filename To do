Notes for later (programming stuff) :

- If cylinder not detected, make sure that it will not taking cube instead : done
- Verify for each fonction if it is detecting the good object. Otherwise it will take at random position :done
- Pass everytime to the transition position to avoid wrong movements
- Always clear camera
